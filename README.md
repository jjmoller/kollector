The application should be run as a Spring-boot Maven project in your chosen IDE.

To do so, you might need to add support in your IDE for:

1. Java (JDK)
1. Spring-boot Maven
2. Thymeleaf

Remember to reload the dependencies before you first build the application. 
Reloading dependencies and waiting for them to install is crucial. 

To use the application you will have to log in. You may sign up with your email address or your Gmail account. The latter does not require you to create a password.

Enjoy!
